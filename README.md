FSEarthtiles (FSET) was originally created by HB-100. This repository contains the code to FSET 1.03B. The program has been updated, and support for automatic water masking has been added for FS9, FSX, and P3D, as well as support for creating imagery for MSFS2020. The program is now much faster as well. The ability to automatically create autogen data using ScenProc has also been added (only applicable to FS9, FSX, and P3D). Please see the tutorial for FS9, FSX, and P3D here: https://github.com/stackTom/FSEarthTiles/blob/main/FSEarthTiles/Docs/Quick%20start%20-%20README%20first%20(FS2004,%20FSX,%20P3D).docx for instructions.

The tutorial for MSFS2020 can be found here: https://github.com/stackTom/FSEarthTiles/blob/main/FSEarthTiles/Docs/Quick%20start%20-%20README%20first%20(MSFS2020).docx

I would like to thank my beta testers, Harry Otter, Walter Almaraz Roca, Sean Galbraith (thanks also for providing web hosting!), John Cillis, and the other individuals who helped to beta test these improvements to make them as bug free as possible.

Also, credit to Harry Otter for the Default Scenproc Scripts!

# Wishlist (TODOs)
* Need to increase provider limit number for FSEarthTiles.ini providers
* Implement rocks and 3steps blurring algorithms from Ortho4XP (sand has been implemented currently)
* Add support for all Ortho4XP providers
