# FSEarthTiles

# Use at your own risk

FSEarthtiles was originally created by HB-100. This repository contains to the code to FSET 1.03B. The program has been updated to version 1.1, and support for automatic water masking has been added. The ability to automatically create autogen data using ScenProc has also been added. Please see the tutorial **here** for instructions.

I would like to thank my beta testers, Harry Otter, Walter Almaraz Roca, Sean Galbraith (thanks also for providing web hosting!), John Cillis, and the other individuals who helped to beta test these improvements to make them as bug free as possible.

Also, credit to Harry Otter for the Default Scenproc Scripts!
