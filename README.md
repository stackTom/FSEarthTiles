# FSEarthTiles

# Requirements
1) 32 or 64 bit Windows XP or greater.
2) .Net Framework v4.0 or later. Download it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework
3) Automatic water masking for FS9, FSX, and P3D requires two further requirements:*
	1) Windows Vista (or greater) 64 bit is required. Automatic water masking will not work on either 32 bit operating systems nor on any version of Windows XP.
	2) Microsoft Visual c++ redistributable. Download it here: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

* If your computer doesn't meet the requirements for automatic water masking, you can always use the AreaKML or SVG methods (partially automatic) of water masking supported by this program, or just create the masks by hand using an image editor (search YouTube for how to do this).

# Use at your own risk

FSEarthtiles (FSET) was originally created by HB-100. This repository contains the code to FSET 1.03B. The program has been updated to version 1.4, and support for automatic water masking has been added for FS9, FSX, and P3D, as well as support for creating imagery for MSFS2020. The ability to automatically create autogen data using ScenProc has also been added (only applicable to FS9, FSX, and P3D). Please see the tutorial for FS9, FSX, and P3D here: https://github.com/stackTom/FSEarthTiles/blob/main/FSEarthTiles/Docs/Quick%20start%20-%20README%20first%20(FS2004,%20FSX,%20P3D).docx for instructions.

The tutorial for MSFS2020 can be found here: https://github.com/stackTom/FSEarthTiles/blob/main/FSEarthTiles/Docs/Quick%20start%20-%20README%20first%20(MSFS2020).docx

I would like to thank my beta testers, Harry Otter, Walter Almaraz Roca, Sean Galbraith (thanks also for providing web hosting!), John Cillis, and the other individuals who helped to beta test these improvements to make them as bug free as possible.

Also, credit to Harry Otter for the Default Scenproc Scripts!

Also, check out my Ortho4XP for FSX/P3D port to create sceneries for FSX and P3D as well: https://github.com/stackTom/Ortho4XP_FSX_P3D

# Wishlist (TODOs)
* Need to increase provider limit number for FSEarthTiles.ini providers
* Implement rocks and 3steps blurring algorithms from Ortho4XP (sand has been implemented currently)
* Add support for all Ortho4XP providers
