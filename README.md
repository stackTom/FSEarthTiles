# FSEarthTiles

# Requirements
1) 32 or 64 bit Windows XP or greater.
2) .Net Framework v4.0 or later. Download it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework
3) Automatic water masking requires two further requirements:*
	1) Windows Vista (or greater) 64 bit is required. Automatic water masking will not work on either 32 bit operating systems nor on any version of Windows XP.
	2) Microsoft Visual c++ redistributable. Download it here: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

* If your computer doesn't meet the requirements for automatic water masking, you can always use the AreaKML or SVG methods (partially automatic) of water masking supported by this program, or just create the masks by hand using an image editor (search YouTube for how to do this).

# Use at your own risk

This repository contains the source code. The program can be downloaded here: https://github.com/stackTom/FSEarthTiles/releases

FSEarthtiles (FSET) was originally created by HB-100. This repository contains to the code to FSET 1.03B. The program has been updated to version 1.3, and support for automatic water masking has been added. The ability to automatically create autogen data using ScenProc has also been added. Please see the tutorial https://github.com/stackTom/FSEarthTiles/blob/main/FSEarthTiles/Docs/Quick%20start%20-%20README%20first.docx for instructions. This video shows an example of creating scenery with the program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snd4Bp5cUR0

I would like to thank my beta testers, Harry Otter, Walter Almaraz Roca, Sean Galbraith (thanks also for providing web hosting!), John Cillis, and the other individuals who helped to beta test these improvements to make them as bug free as possible.

Also, credit to Harry Otter for the Default Scenproc Scripts!

# Wishlist (TODOs)
* Need to increase provider limit number for FSEarthTiles.ini providers
* Implement rocks and 3steps blurring algorithms from Ortho4XP (sand has been implemented currently)
