# Generate mesh data using Ortho4XP API

This folder contains createMesh.py. This file can be compiled into an exe using pyinstaller as follows:

`pyinstaller --clean -F -p src createMesh.py`.

Note: The src/ folder from Ortho4XP_FSX_P3D (https://github.com/stackTom/Ortho4XP_FSX_P3D) must be present in the same folder as createMesh.py (or, just download Ortho4XP_FSX_P3D, place createMesh.py into the folder containing src/, and use pyinstaller as above).
