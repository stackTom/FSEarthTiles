FS Earth Tiles
---------------

 FSEarthTiles is a flightsimulator tool I started to develop for me and you inspired by the cool TileProxy project helping you to get 
 photo-textures as static addon scenery into the flightsimulator by accessing earth services.

  
   !! IMPORTANT !!
  
   All earth services have copyright on their material! That means you may not distribute sceneries you create that includes such material. 
   You are also not really allowed to download such material and store and use it in FS or elswhere without the permission of the services. 




Installation
-------------

 1. Create a folder "FSEarthTiles" for this application and unzip the package into this folder.
 
 2. Open the file FSEarthTiles.ini and complete the Service configurations! For legal reason they are only preconfigurated. (*)
    Read what is written at the beginning of that file. The internet is a very helpfull source to figure out valid configurations. 
    So use it and do an active search. Do NOT post and asking me for a configuration! And don't be lazzy asking others to do your work.
    It is simple enough to figure out a valid configuration!

To compile a scenery for the Flight Simulator you need the scenery compilers of th FS SDK's that eighter comes with the FS Deluxe 
versions or you can download from the microsoft pages:

 3. From the FSX terrain SDK (SP2) copy the resample.exe and place it into the FSEarthTiles Folder and rename it to resampleFSXSP2.exe 

 4. From the FS2004 terrain SDK copy the resample.exe and place it into the FSEarthTiles Folder and rename it to resampleFS2004.exe
 
 5. From the FS2004  SDK copy the imagetool.exe and place it into the FSEarthTiles Folder and rename it to imagetoolFS2004.exe

FSEarthTiles Future

I (HB-100) self will not continue the development of FS Earth Tiles.
I welcome if anyone want to pick it up and continue the development of FSET. 
For this purpose I made the sources of v1.0 public and give everyone the right to use them for your own projects 
with no restrictions. Before you start a good idea is to check what projects already exists.
